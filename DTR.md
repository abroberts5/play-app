# Project:  play-play
## Group Member Names:
* J Aaron Brooks-Roberts
* Nick Lindeberg

### Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?
A- I’m comfortable with being uncomfortable at this point and I’m primarily looking to further my understanding of working with CircleCI, Express for the BackEnd, and testing with Mocha and Chai.
N - I am really enjoying working with the front end and am looking to push myself to learn new techniques using javascript.
### Goals and expectations:
A - To complete the project with a 3 and be able to speak to process and “if we had more time”’s in a way that will help in the interview process.
N - Agreed with Aaron.  
### Team strengths:
A - Time… I will take whatever amount of time it takes to move the project forward. Also my mentor is awesome and willing to help out whenever - Aurora
N - I feel really solid with Rspec testing so I assume I should be able to translate those skills into working with Mocha and Chai.  
### How to overcome obstacles:
A - If we’ve hit a point that requires outside help, we have the resources to get it done. I have no personal ego and I’m always open to communicate constructively.
N - Agreed.  I have worked through tons of projects and have never had any major issues around personalities.  Plus Aaron is a super nice guy!  
### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
A - I would prefer to pair in the initial days to understand our process and to talk through some things together initially. I find it easier to understand the direction we’ve set and the best way to approach tasks as a team so it makes it easier to manage PRs and take missing pieces in consideration.
N - I usually like to get out of the building around 6 to 6:30.  I’m happy to pair on a good chunk of the project. I don’t have much going on outside of school so I should have lots of time.
### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
A - I think we should definitely have daily communication at the end of every day and also slack each other when there is a PR in que.
N - Agreed.  
### Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
A - Same as Project Expectations
N - Ditto
### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
A - Whatever it takes, but I’m much more interested in the BackEnd portion of the project specifically but also how it will translate to the FE.
N - I really want to work on the front end for the most part.  Once we have the back end built out it should be easier to build the front end.  
### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
A - Request review from partner each PR and when paired, maybe update using co-authored updates.
N - Never merge your own PR.  
### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
A - No issues with communication at all. Like feedback the most when it’s constructive.
N - Be nice and specific.  We should be just fine.  
### Agenda to discuss project launch:
A - Talking at 1pm 3/18 and will complete cards and initial repo today
N - Cards written for the back end.  Reviewing the express lesson for tomorrow

### Tools:
Moch, Chia, Express, GitHub Pages, MusicMatch API, Ajax, Pivotal Tracker
